### **Whole Genome Sequecing(WGS) of Human Genome with 50X coverage on Nvidia Ampere 100 GPU's**

Nvidia Ampere 100 GPU's exploits wide SIMD architecture to accelerate worlds most demanding HPC and AI workloads, and one of the key apllication in HPC is Whole Genome Sequencing of Human Genome. This blog aims to benchmark runtime comparison of WGS of Human Genome with 50X coverage with multiple GPU's to help understand how quickly we can sequence Human Genome with one of the fastest compute architecture in the world.
