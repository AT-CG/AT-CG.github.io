# **Hop On**

We are actively on the lookout for motivated students and post-docs to join our group and always have open positions!

### **Prospective students:**

If you would like to work with us, please write to the [PI](mailto:chirag@iisc.ac.in). Masters and PhD admissions usually have to go through the procedures setup by [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/admissions/), followed by an interview with the [Materials Engineering department](). Students interested in pursuing inter-disciplinary degree programs, such as [ICER]() and [CENSE]() are also welcome.

### **Prospective Post-doctoral researchers:**
Please write to the [PI](mailto:chirag@iisc.ac.in) to discuss possibilities. Listed below are some of the fellowship opportunities that post-docs joining IISc typically avail.
